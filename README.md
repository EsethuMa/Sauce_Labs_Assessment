#Sauce Labs Demo Assessment Test

How to run the whole End_To_End script

Navigate to this file : Building_Practise/testngWINDOWS.xml Rung the TestNG file to execute the automation

My approach in this assessment was to use pre-defined methods and also created new ones in order to accomodate some of the actions based on the requirements. The POM file is updated with the latest and correct working dependencies, the script is running on testNG which allows parallel and headless execution of scripts. I have also used reusable methods that handles error like Waits and verifying that the page element is available before action.
